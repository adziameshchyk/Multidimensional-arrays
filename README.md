# Multidimensional arrays

>This repository was created for homework in lesson â„–4 - "Multidimensional arrays".

## Tasks:

0. Create a 3D array of integers.
   With the help of loops "pass" through the entire array and increase each element by a given number.
   Let the number by which each element will be incremented be specified from the console.
1. Write a program to tell a chessboard using a loop.
   Create a two-dimensional array of 8x8 Strings.
   With the help of cycles, set the values of B(Black) or W(White) to the elements of the cycle.
   The result of the program:
   W  B  W  B  W  B  W  B
   B  W  B  W  B  W  B  W
   W  B  W  B  W  B  W  B
   B  W  B  W  B  W  B  W
   W  B  W  B  W  B  W  B
   B  W  B  W  B  W  B  W
   W  B  W  B  W  B  W  B
   B  W  B  W  B  W  B  W
2. Matrix multiplication: Create two integer arrays of size 3x3 (two matrices).
   Write a program to multiply these two matrices.
   First array: {{1,0,0,0},{0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,0}}
   Second array: {{1,2,3},{1,1,1},{0,0,0},{2,1,0}}
   Expected output:
   1 2 3
   1 1 1
   0 0 0
3. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Output the sum of all elements of the array to the console.
4. Create a two-dimensional array. Print the diagonals of the array to the console.
5. Create a two-dimensional array of integers. Sort the elements in the rows of a two-dimensional array in ascending order.
